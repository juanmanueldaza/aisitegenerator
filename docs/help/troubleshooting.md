# Troubleshooting GitHub Authentication

Common issues and solutions for GitHub OAuth authentication and permissions.

## Authentication Issues

### Problem: "OAuth App access restrictions" Error

**Symptoms:**
- Unable to authorize the application
- Error message about OAuth app restrictions
- Redirection back to authorization page

**Causes:**
- Your organization has restricted OAuth app access
- The application is not on your organization's approved list
- Organization security policies prevent third-party app authorization

**Solutions:**

1. **Contact Organization Admin**
   - Ask your organization administrator to approve the AI Site Generator
   - Provide the app details: name, developer, and required permissions
   - Request addition to the organization's approved applications list

2. **Check Organization Settings**
   - Go to your organization's settings
   - Navigate to "Third-party application access policy"
   - Review the current restrictions and approved applications

3. **Use Personal Account**
   - If possible, use a personal GitHub account instead
   - Note: This may limit access to organization repositories

**Prevention:**
- Check organization policies before attempting authorization
- Request pre-approval for necessary applications
- Maintain communication with your organization's security team

### Problem: Redirect Loop During Authentication

**Symptoms:**
- Browser continuously redirects between GitHub and the application
- Authentication never completes
- "Too many redirects" error

**Causes:**
- Browser cookies or cache issues
- Conflicting browser extensions
- Network proxy or firewall interference
- Corrupted session data

**Solutions:**

1. **Clear Browser Data**
   ```
   1. Open browser settings
   2. Clear browsing data for the last 24 hours
   3. Include cookies, cache, and site data
   4. Restart browser and try again
   ```

2. **Disable Browser Extensions**
   - Temporarily disable ad blockers and privacy extensions
   - Try authentication in incognito/private browsing mode
   - Re-enable extensions one by one to identify conflicts

3. **Check Network Settings**
   - Disable VPN or proxy temporarily
   - Try from a different network
   - Contact IT support if using corporate network

4. **Use Different Browser**
   - Try a different browser or device
   - Update your browser to the latest version

**Prevention:**
- Regularly clear browser data
- Keep browser updated
- Use standard browser settings for OAuth

### Problem: "Application Suspended" Message

**Symptoms:**
- Error message stating the OAuth application is suspended
- Unable to complete authorization
- GitHub shows application as unavailable

**Causes:**
- The OAuth application has violated GitHub's terms of service
- Temporary suspension due to security concerns
- Application developer account issues

**Solutions:**

1. **Wait and Retry**
   - Temporary suspensions may be resolved automatically
   - Try again after a few hours

2. **Contact Application Support**
   - Reach out to the AI Site Generator support team
   - Report the suspension issue
   - Ask for estimated resolution time

3. **Check Alternative Access Methods**
   - Look for alternative ways to access the service
   - Use backup authentication methods if available

4. **Monitor Status Updates**
   - Check the application's status page or social media
   - Subscribe to updates about service restoration

**Prevention:**
- Use applications from reputable developers
- Check application reviews and ratings
- Have backup tools available
