# Removal/Consolidation Candidates

These files are scaffolding or one-off operational docs. Consider removing or merging into README after production hardening:

- README_VITE.md — Fold relevant Vite usage into README
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md — Merge key notes into DEVELOPMENT.md
- WORKFLOW_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md — Archive or link in PRs only
- close-prs.sh — Remove after PR backlog cleanup is complete
- public/vite.svg, src/assets/react.svg — Remove once favicon and branding assets are in place
- PR_CLOSURE_INSTRUCTIONS.md — Keep if still closing historical PRs; otherwise archive

This list is advisory; confirm references before deleting.
