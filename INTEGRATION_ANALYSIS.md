**Goal:** Implement multimedia and advanced AI capabilities

### Phase 5: Optimization & Polish

**Goal:** Performance optimization and UX enhancements

## üèóÔ∏è **Current Architecture Analysis**

### Existing Components:

- `ChatInterface.tsx` - Current chat implementation
- `useAIProvider` hook - AI service abstraction
- Gemini service integration
- Site store for state management

### Integration Points:

1. **Chat Interface Replacement/Enhancement**
2. **AI Service Layer Modernization**
3. **State Management Updates**
4. **UI/UX Consistency**
5. **Error Handling & Retry Logic**

## üìä **Compatibility Assessment**

### Current Dependencies:

```json
{
  "@google/generative-ai": "^0.21.0",
  "react": "^19.1.1",
  "react-dom": "^19.1.1"
}
```

### Required Dependencies:

```json
{
  "deep-chat-react": "^2.2.2",
  "ai": "^5.0.15",
  "@ai-sdk/react": "^5.0.15",
  "@ai-sdk/openai": "^5.0.15",
  "@ai-sdk/google": "^5.0.15"
}
```

### Potential Conflicts:

- No major dependency conflicts identified
- React 19 compatibility confirmed for both libraries
- Bundle size increase: ~300KB for Deep Chat, ~500KB for AI SDK

   - Memory usage with multimedia features

### Medium Priority Challenges:

4. **API Migration Complexity**
   - Current Gemini integration vs AI SDK abstraction
   - Streaming implementation differences
   - Error handling migration

5. **Feature Parity**
   - Maintaining current functionality
   - Progressive enhancement approach
   - Backward compatibility

### Low Priority Challenges:

6. **Testing Strategy**
   - Component testing with external dependencies
   - E2E testing with multimedia features
   - Mock strategies for AI providers

## üé® **Design Considerations**
