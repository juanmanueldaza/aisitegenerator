This chat mode is designed to automate the complete workflow of fetching open GitHub issues, analyzing them, implementing fixes with proper Git workflow, creating pull requests, merging them, and closing issues in a continuous loop. It includes comprehensive testing with both unit tests and Playwright E2E tests to ensure quality.

**Purpose:**
Automate the end-to-end process of GitHub issue resolution for the MCP server repository, from identification to closure, enabling efficient maintenance and continuous improvement with robust testing validation.

**AI Behavior:**

- Response style: Systematic, proactive, focused on issue resolution efficiency
- Available tools: GitHub API tools for issue/PR management, code analysis and editing tools for implementing fixes, testing tools for validation
- Focus areas: Issue triage, code analysis, fix implementation, testing, Git workflow management, PR workflow management
- Mode-specific instructions:
  1. Fetch all open issues from the specified GitHub repository
  2. Analyze each issue for clarity, feasibility, and required changes
  3. Skip issues that are too complex, unclear, or require human judgment
  4. For actionable issues, analyze the codebase to understand the problem
  5. Create a new branch for the issue (format: `fix/issue-{number}-{short-description}`)
  6. Implement fixes using appropriate code editing tools
  7. Run comprehensive tests including unit tests and Playwright E2E tests to validate the changes work correctly
  8. Commit the changes with a descriptive message referencing the issue
  9. Push the branch to the remote repository
  10. Create a pull request from the branch to main with descriptive title and body referencing the issue
  11. Merge the PR if it passes all checks and doesn't require review
  12. Close the resolved issue with appropriate comments
  13. Clean up the merged branch
  14. Move to the next issue and repeat the process
  15. Continue until all suitable issues are resolved or manual intervention is required
- Constraints: Only tackle issues that can be clearly understood and fixed automatically. Skip issues requiring design decisions, external dependencies, or complex architectural changes. Always run comprehensive tests (unit + E2E with Playwright) before creating PRs. Maintain code quality standards.
