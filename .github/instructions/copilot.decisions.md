# Decision Making Guidelines for AI Site Generator

## 🎯 **Technical Decision Framework**

When making technical decisions for AI Site Generator, consider these priorities in order:

### **1. Core Constraints Compliance**

- **Bundle Size**: Will this increase the bundle beyond reasonable limits?
- **Frontend-Only**: Does this maintain the client-side-only architecture?
- **Security**: Does this introduce security vulnerabilities?
- **Performance**: Will this negatively impact user experience?

### **2. User Experience Impact**

- **Simplicity**: Does this make the tool easier to use?
- **Speed**: Does this improve or maintain performance?
- **Reliability**: Does this increase system stability?
- **Accessibility**: Does this maintain or improve accessibility?

### **3. Developer Experience**

- **Maintainability**: Is this easy to maintain long-term?
- **Testability**: Can this be properly tested?
- **Documentation**: Is this easy to understand and document?
- **Scalability**: Will this work as the project grows?

## 📋 **Decision Categories**

### **🏗️ Architecture Decisions**

**Framework Choices**

- ✅ React: Component reusability, ecosystem, TypeScript support
- ✅ Vite: Fast builds, modern tooling, good defaults
- ✅ TypeScript: Type safety, better DX, documentation

**State Management**

- ✅ Zustand: Lightweight, TypeScript-friendly, persistence support
- ✅ React hooks: Component-level state management
- ❌ Redux: Adds complexity without significant benefit for this scale

**Styling Approach**

- ✅ CSS Modules/Plain CSS: Simple, no runtime overhead
- ❌ Styled-components: Runtime overhead, bundle size impact

### **🔧 Implementation Decisions**

**API Integration Patterns**

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Direct service integration
const result = await githubService.createRepository(data);

// ❌ Avoid: Unnecessary abstraction layers
const result = await apiManager.github.repositories.create(data);
```

**Error Handling Strategy**

```typescript
// ✅ Good: User-friendly error messages
try {
  await action();
} catch (error) {
  showUserFriendlyError(error);
  logErrorForDebugging(error);
}

// ❌ Avoid: Raw error exposure
catch (error) {
  alert(error.message); // Too technical for users
}
```

### **🎨 UI/UX Decisions**

**Component Design Philosophy**

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity as needed
- **Immediate Feedback**: Always show loading states and progress
- **Error Recovery**: Provide clear paths to resolve issues
- **Mobile-First**: Ensure mobile usability

**Interaction Patterns**

- ✅ Standard web patterns (buttons, forms, modals)
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Screen reader compatibility
- ❌ Custom UI paradigms that confuse users

### **📊 Performance Decisions**

**Bundle Size Management**

```bash
# Decision criteria for dependencies
npm install new-package  # Only if:
# 1. Adds significant value
# 2. No reasonable alternative exists
# 3. Treeshakable or small size
# 4. Actively maintained
```

**Rendering Optimization**

- ✅ Lazy loading for non-critical components
- ✅ Memoization for expensive computations
- ❌ Premature optimization without measurement

### **🔒 Security Decisions**

**Input Handling**

```typescript
// ✅ Always sanitize user input
const sanitizedInput = sanitizeHtml(userInput);

// ✅ Validate on multiple levels
const isValid = validateInput(input) && validateSchema(input);
```

**API Security**

- ✅ Store tokens securely (not in localStorage)
- ✅ Use HTTPS for all communications
- ✅ Implement proper CORS policies
- ✅ Validate all external data

## 🔄 **Decision Review Process**

### **Before Implementation**

1. **Impact Assessment**: What does this change?
2. **Alternative Analysis**: What other options exist?
3. **Risk Evaluation**: What could go wrong?
4. **Success Metrics**: How will we measure success?

### **During Implementation**

1. **Regular Review**: Are we staying on track?
2. **Testing Strategy**: How do we validate this works?
3. **Documentation**: Is this decision captured?

### **After Implementation**

1. **Performance Impact**: Did this meet expectations?
2. **User Feedback**: How do users respond?
3. **Maintenance Burden**: Is this sustainable?
4. **Learning Capture**: What did we learn?

## 📝 **Decision Documentation**

Document significant decisions using this template:

```markdown
## Decision: [Title]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated

### Context

What is the situation requiring a decision?

### Decision

What did we decide to do?

### Rationale

Why did we choose this option?

### Consequences

- Positive: What benefits do we expect?
- Negative: What trade-offs are we accepting?
- Risks: What could go wrong?

### Alternatives Considered

What other options did we evaluate?
```

## 🎯 **Common Decision Patterns**

### **When to Add a Dependency**

```
Question: Should we add package X?
✅ Yes if:
  - Solves a real problem we face
  - Well-maintained and popular
  - Size impact is justified
  - No reasonable in-house alternative

❌ No if:
  - Adds unnecessary complexity
  - Large bundle size impact
  - Poor maintenance record
  - Easy to implement ourselves
```

### **When to Refactor Code**

```
Question: Should we refactor component Y?
✅ Yes if:
  - Hard to understand or maintain
  - Performance issues identified
  - Adding features is difficult
  - Technical debt is accumulating

❌ No if:
  - Works well and is stable
  - Would break existing functionality
  - No clear benefit to users
  - Other priorities are more important
```

Remember: **Good decisions are reversible, documented, and aligned with project goals.**
