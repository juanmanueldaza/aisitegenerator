# Frequently Asked Questions

## GitHub Permissions and Security

### Q: Why does the AI Site Generator need access to my GitHub account?

**A:** We need GitHub access to create and manage repositories for your generated websites. This includes:
- Creating new repositories for each website you generate
- Committing HTML, CSS, and asset files to these repositories
- Enabling GitHub Pages to make your websites publicly accessible
- Managing repository settings for optimal performance

We only access repositories we create for your websites - we cannot see or modify your existing personal repositories.

### Q: What GitHub permissions does the app request and why?

**A:** We request three main permission scopes:

1. **Repository access (`repo`)**: To create and manage website repositories
2. **User information (`user`)**: To personalize your experience and provide proper attribution
3. **GitHub Pages (`pages`)**: To automatically publish your websites

These are the minimum permissions required to provide our service effectively.

### Q: Can you access my private repositories?

**A:** No, we cannot access your existing private repositories. While we request the `repo` scope, we only use this permission to:
- Create new public repositories for your generated websites
- Manage the repositories we create on your behalf

Your existing repositories, whether public or private, remain completely inaccessible to our application.

### Q: How can I revoke the app's access to my GitHub account?

**A:** You can revoke access at any time:

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Applications → Authorized OAuth Apps
2. Find "AI Site Generator" in the list
3. Click "Revoke" next to the application
4. Confirm the revocation

After revoking access, your generated websites will continue to work, but you won't be able to make updates through our application.

### Q: What happens to my websites if I revoke access?

**A:** Your websites will continue to function normally:
- All generated websites remain live on GitHub Pages
- Repository files and history are preserved
- You maintain full ownership of all repositories created
- You can manually edit files through GitHub's interface

You simply won't be able to use our application to make further updates.

## Using the AI Site Generator

### Q: How do I get started with creating my first website?

**A:** Getting started is simple:

5. Deploy your website with one click

The entire process typically takes 5-10 minutes for a complete website.

### Q: Can I customize the generated websites?

**A:** Yes! You have several customization options:

- **During generation**: Provide detailed descriptions to guide the AI

Most users have a live website within 10 minutes of starting.

4. GitHub will automatically handle HTTPS certificates

Detailed instructions are provided in your repository's settings.

### Q: How do I update my website after it's created?

Pro plans offer additional features like private repositories and advanced collaboration tools, but aren't required for website generation.

## Troubleshooting

### Q: The authentication isn't working. What should I do?

**A:** Try these troubleshooting steps:

1. **Clear browser cache and cookies**
2. **Disable browser extensions** that might interfere
