Welcome to the AI Site Generator! This step-by-step tutorial will guide you through creating and deploying your first website using our AI-powered platform.

## Before You Start

### What You'll Need
- A GitHub account (free plan is sufficient)
- About 10-15 minutes of your time
- A basic idea of what kind of website you want to create

### What You'll Learn

- Customizing the generated content
- Deploying your site to GitHub Pages
- Managing your websites after creation

## Step 1: Understanding GitHub Authentication

### Why GitHub Authentication?
Before we begin, it's important to understand why we need access to your GitHub account:

1. **Repository Creation**: We create a new GitHub repository for each website you generate
2. **File Management**: We commit your website files (HTML, CSS, images) to this repository
3. **Deployment**: We enable GitHub Pages to make your website publicly accessible
4. **Ownership**: You maintain full ownership and control of all generated content

### Security First
Your security is our top priority. Here's what you should know:

- ‚úÖ We only access repositories we create for your websites
- ‚úÖ We cannot see or modify your existing repositories
- ‚úÖ You can revoke our access at any time
- ‚úÖ We use industry-standard OAuth security protocols

### Permissions We Request

When you authenticate, we'll request these specific permissions:

#### üîê Repository Access (`repo`)
**What it allows:**
- Create new public repositories for your websites
- Commit generated files to these repositories
- Configure repository settings for optimal performance

**What we DON'T do:**
- Access your existing personal repositories
- Read private code or sensitive information
- Make unauthorized changes to your projects

#### üë§ User Information (`user`)
**What it allows:**
- Get your username for personalized experience
- Access your public email for notifications
- Read basic profile information for attribution

**What we DON'T do:**
- Store unnecessary personal information
- Share your data with third parties
- Access private personal details

#### üåê GitHub Pages (`pages`)
**What it allows:**
- Enable GitHub Pages on your website repositories
- Configure deployment settings automatically
- Manage publishing options for your sites

### Ready to Authenticate?

When you're ready to proceed:
1. Click the "Connect GitHub" button
2. Review the permissions carefully
3. Click "Authorize" to grant access
4. You'll be redirected back to our application

**Remember**: You can revoke this access at any time through your GitHub Settings ‚Üí Applications.

## Step 2: Planning Your Website

### Naming Your Repository

Your website repository name will determine your GitHub Pages URL:

**Tips for choosing a name:**
- Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- Keep it short and memorable

## Step 3: Working with the AI Assistant

### Starting Your Website Creation

Once authenticated, you'll interact with our AI assistant to create your website:

2. **Provide Details**: Share specific requirements, content, or preferences
3. **Review Suggestions**: The AI will ask clarifying questions
4. **Confirm Approach**: Approve the AI's understanding of your needs

### Best Practices for AI Interaction

#### Be Specific
Instead of: "I want a business website"
Try: "I need a landing page for my freelance graphic design business, showcasing my portfolio and contact information"

#### Provide Context

- Describe your target audience
- Share any existing branding or style preferences
- List specific features you need

#### Iterate and Refine
- Review the AI's initial suggestions
- Ask for modifications if needed
- Provide feedback on generated content
- Request additional features or sections

### Example Conversation

**You**: "I want to create a portfolio website for my photography business"

**AI**: "Great! I'd love to help you create a photography portfolio. Can you tell me:
- What type of photography do you specialize in?
- Do you have specific photos you'd like to showcase?
- Would you like to include pricing information?
- Do you need a contact form for bookings?"

**You**: "I specialize in wedding photography. I'd like to showcase my best work in a gallery, include information about my packages, and have a contact form for inquiries."

**AI**: "Perfect! I'll create a wedding photography portfolio with:
- A stunning hero section with your best photo
- A gallery showcasing your wedding photography
- A services section with package information
- A contact form for potential clients
- An about section with your story
